# Murmurent

Murmurent is an agentic AI operating system that provides:

- **Reference agents**: a set of specialist agents (literature search,
  computation, adversarial review, security audit, and others), designed
  and initialized for biomedical and basic life-science research, that you
  delegate to by name.
- **An Obsidian-based vault**: your private, git-backed knowledge base that
  survives across sessions and projects. It holds your **Oracle** (personal
  and lab-shared structured memory), your daily lab notebook, and your own
  notes and maps.
- **Hard rules and hooks**: data-governance guardrails enforced in
  software. Directories can be marked immutable (to protect sensitive raw
  data) or append-only (to accumulate analyses without overwriting them),
  and there are guardrails against committing sensitive data such as
  passwords and clinical records.
- **Cryptographic membership**: labs, cores, and projects are held together
  by signed identity certificates (centre root → PI → lead → member).
- **The commons**: independent groups sharing a common set of agents,
  rules, and infrastructure, so institutional knowledge accumulates across
  projects and personnel instead of being trapped on one machine.

Murmurent is built on [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) today,
although nothing in its design is tied to it: the same tiers, agents, and
governance rules could run on another agentic AI system.

You can use Murmurent on your own. You do not need a lab or a centre to
participate: the reference agents, the vault, and the governance rules all
work for a single researcher on one machine. A lab or centre adds shared
memory and infrastructure on top, when you want it.

## How a centre is organized

Murmurent is structured around four types of entities:

- **Individual members**: each person has their own membership identity,
  their own agents, and their own personal vault.
- **Groups**: a group is either a **lab** (a research group) or a **core**
  (a shared facility such as a proteomics or imaging centre). Every group is
  led by a **PI** and owns its own members, data, and workflows.
- **Projects**: a project is a unit of work that brings individual members
  together around shared repositories and data. Its members can come from a
  single group or from several groups at once.
- **The administration**: the centre-level layer that maintains the
  registry of groups and projects and issues the identity certificates that
  bind members, groups, and projects together.

Each group documents and runs its own workflows on top of the shared agents
and rules, keeping authority over its own people and data, while the
administration maintains the shared registry and trust chain.
