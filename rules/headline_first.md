# Headline-first protocol

Every murmurent agent — main and subagent — must begin its final response
to the user with a **single line of ≤200 characters** that summarises
the outcome in the agent's own voice. Detail (tables, per-finding
breakdowns, code listings) follows after one blank line.

## Why

The murmurent VSCode workflow shows live subagent activity in the BR
(bottom-right) pane via `tail -F ~/.murmurent/agents.log`. The hook
handler ([scripts/murmurent_log_agent_event.sh](../scripts/murmurent_log_agent_event.sh))
captures each subagent's `last_assistant_message` on `SubagentStop`,
strips newlines, and truncates to 200 chars. Whatever sits in the
first 200 chars of your reply is the *only* thing the user sees in
the dashboard.

If you bury the verdict in paragraph three, the BR pane shows three
sentences of throat-clearing and the user has to re-read your full
reply to find the conclusion. If you lead with the verdict, the
dashboard becomes useful.

## Format

The headline should answer one question: **what's the punchline?**
Use the categorical verb that matches your agent's standard verdict
vocabulary:

| Agent | Lead with |
|---|---|
| `security_guard` | `Clear / Concerns / Blocked — <one-line why>` |
| `adversary` | `Pass / Questions / Reject — <one-line why>` |
| `oracle` | `Found / Not found / Unsure — <one-line what>` |
| `lab_oracle` | `Found / Not found / Unsure — <one-line what, naming the publisher>` |
| `bookworm` | `Found N sources — <one-line summary>` |
| `blacksmith` | `Done / Failed / Partial — <one-line what>` |
| `artist` | `Rendered / Skipped / Failed — <one-line what>` |
| `conscience` | `OK / Flagged — <one-line concern>` |
| `lawyer` | `Clear / Conflict / Unknown — <one-line on patent landscape>` |
| `cable_guy` | `Provisioned / Skipped / Failed — <one-line on what>` |
| `centre_cable_guy` | `Reconciled / Drift / BLOCKED — <one-line on what changed or what is blocking>` |
| `registrar` | `Recorded / Conflict / Skipped — <one-line on what>` |
| `judge` | `Presented / Split / Insufficient — <one-line on the combined result>` |
| `teacher` | `Explained / Gap — <one-line on what was/wasn't understood>` |

Then a blank line. Then the detail. Example:

```
Clear — no world-writable or sensitive-readable files in scope.

**Security Guard Audit — /Users/mth/repos/murmurent**
1. World-writable files: none found.
2. World-readable sensitive matches: none found.
3. World-executable shell scripts in scripts/: 7 (all intentional).

Verdict: CLEAR
```

## Adding an agent

**This table must list every agent in [`agents/`](../agents/).** It went two
agents out of date (`centre_cable_guy`, `lab_oracle`) because nothing tied the
two together: both agents declared their verdicts in their own files, so
nothing was broken and nothing complained. If you add an agent, add its row
here in the same commit, and take the vocabulary from the agent's own
`MANDATORY OUTPUT RULE` line rather than inventing one that looks plausible.

## When in doubt

If your output is a single short sentence anyway (e.g. answering a
trivial factual question), that sentence IS the headline — no extra
formatting needed. The rule only kicks in when you have structured
output to deliver.
