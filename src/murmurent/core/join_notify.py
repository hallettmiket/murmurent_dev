"""
Purpose: Slack routing for the centre join flow (Phase 2 communication
         backbone). When a join request is filed, notify the centre's
         registrars via the admin broadcast channel; when it is resolved,
         DM the requester with the outcome.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-07-03

Every function here is **best-effort and never raises** — a join request
must still succeed if Slack is down, the bot token is missing, or the
admin channel isn't configured yet. That mirrors ``dashboard/slack_notify``
(fire-and-forget). All Slack I/O is injectable so tests never hit the wire.

Defaults resolve to the live helpers:
  - ``poster``           → ``slack_notify._post(channel, text)``
  - ``channel_resolver`` → ``broadcasts.channel_id_for(audience, env=...)``
  - ``user_resolver``    → ``slack_notify._lookup_user_id_by_email(email)``

The routing is intentionally coarse: new requests post to the **admin**
channel (the mayor + registrars watch it) rather than DMing each registrar
individually, and the requester is DM'd by the email they supplied. DMing
the matched PI directly is a later refinement (needs a handle→Slack-id map).
