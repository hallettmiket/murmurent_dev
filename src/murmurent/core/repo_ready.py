"""
Purpose: Repo-level murmurent READINESS — distinct from projects.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-07-15
Input: A git working tree (``~/repos/<name>``) + the murmurent commons clone.
Output: A ``.murmurent.yaml`` marker at the repo root + the layer-2 CC
        bootstrap (commons agent symlinks, CLAUDE.md stub, chrome).

Terminology (the point of this module): a repo with the murmurent
bootstrap is **murmurent-ready** — nothing more. A *project* is a
different, bigger thing: a named set of repos + a set of members (+
Slack channel, certificates), recorded in the lab_mgmt registry
(``cert_projects/``). Adopting a repo makes it ready; creating a
project attaches ready repos to a project record. Historically the two
were fused — adopting wrote a project-ish ``CHARTER.md`` into the repo
AND minted a one-repo project — which is how five trial adoptions
polluted a Projects panel (issue context: 2026-07-15).

The marker also solves the upgrade problem: agent CONTENT updates flow
automatically (agents are symlinks into the commons clone), but
structural changes — new commons agents, marker schema, refreshed
stubs — are frozen at bootstrap time. ``upgrade()`` re-runs the
bootstrap idempotently against the current commons and re-stamps
``bootstrap_version``; for a legacy CHARTER.md bootstrap it stamps the
marker while PRESERVING the CHARTER.md (which may be a project document —
readiness just stops keying on it; issue #28).

    ``doctor`` would report the commons coming from ``~/repos/murmurent_dev``

    is the worst shape a failure like this can take: no error, and the thing
    you just changed appears not to work.

    the lab registry — attach the repo to a project separately. ``lab``
    is recorded so multi-lab machines know whose commons this repo
    follows. Idempotent: an existing marker is preserved (its agent
    picks win when ``agents`` is None); re-running refreshes symlinks.
