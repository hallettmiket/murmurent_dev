"""
Purpose: THIS-machine + cross-GitHub git-repo inventory for the dashboard.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-15 (this-machine-only since 2026-07, issue #94)
Input: Lab's GitHub org (``lab.md:github_org``), this machine's scan dirs
       (the ``local`` host's ``scan_dirs``, defaulting to ``~/repo`` +
       ``~/repos``; both ``$HOME``-relative and absolute paths are accepted),
       and this machine's private-repo exclusions (``exclude.yaml``).
Output: ``InventoryReport`` — list of rows keyed by canonical origin URL,
        each row carrying this-machine presence + murmurent-ready signals.

Why this module exists: the dashboard's "Repos" panel surfaces THIS
machine's repos cross-referenced against the lab's GitHub org, so the
user can see at a glance which repos are murmurent-ready here, which are
GitHub-only (could be cloned to this machine), and which are local-only
(at risk of loss because they have no GitHub remote).

Scope (issue #94): the inventory is **this-machine-only**. The retired
"SSH into every registered host and scan it" sweep is gone — under the
per-machine model each machine runs its own dashboard, and you view
another machine's repos by tunnelling to ITS dashboard
(``docs/remote_dashboard.md``), not by driving it from here.

The inventory is **cheap to re-run** (one local ``find`` pass, one
``gh repo list`` per org) so the dashboard's Refresh button can fire it
on demand without paying for an agent loop.
