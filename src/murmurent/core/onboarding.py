"""PI onboarding tracker + step-by-step DM reporter.

After a lab/core is approved and the PI is emailed the workspace invite, the
mayor runs ``murmurent onboard-check``. For each group whose PI has not been
onboarded yet it looks the PI up in the Slack workspace by email; once they have
joined it (a) adds them to the group's channel, (b) DMs them a step-by-step
acknowledgement (registrar -> millwright -> security_guard -> dashboard), and
(c) marks them onboarded so it never double-reports.

Polling by design: no Slack Events webhook to stand up. The mayor runs the
command (or a cron does) and it converges. Everything Slack is token-gated +
best-effort + injectable so the token-less test suite never hits the wire.
