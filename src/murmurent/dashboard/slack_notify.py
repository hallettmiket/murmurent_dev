"""
Purpose: Post dashboard event notifications to Slack.
         Uses the Slack Web API (chat.postMessage) with a bot token
         stored in $MURMURENT_SLACK_TOKEN or ~/.config/murmurent/slack-token.
         All functions are no-ops when no token is configured, so the
         server starts cleanly without Slack auth.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-11
Input: Event data from dashboard API endpoints.
Output: HTTP POST to Slack; silent no-op when token is absent.

    the message text next to the file, so callers can attach a bundle *and* the
    import instructions in one DM.

    Like :func:`_post`, this never raises: any failure (missing scope, Slack
    outage) is caught and reported, so card issuance can fall back to manual
    delivery. Returns a :class:`SlackUploadResult` — truthy on success, and on
    failure carrying the failing ``step`` + Slack ``error`` code so the caller
    can tell the PI exactly what to fix (a bare bool couldn't say *why*). The
    result stays truthy/falsy so ``if _upload_file(...):`` callers are unaffected.
