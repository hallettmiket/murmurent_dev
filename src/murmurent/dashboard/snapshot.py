"""
Purpose: Build the hi-fi ``DashboardResponse`` from real murmurent data.
         Reuses the existing ``murmurent.core.dashboard`` snapshot for member /
         peers / SEAs / projects, then adds the new fields the redesign
         requires (today, attention, stats, spark, heatmap, notifs, notebook).
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-08
Input: ``handle`` (Western username) and the local lab-mgmt + project repos.
Output: ``DashboardResponse`` matching ``hifi-data.jsx`` field-for-field.

Where real data isn't wired yet, we return shape-correct placeholders marked
with a TODO comment so a later phase can swap them out without touching the
contract or the JSX panels.
