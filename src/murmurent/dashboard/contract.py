"""
Purpose: Data contract for the hi-fi dashboard. Mirrors ``hifi-data.jsx``
         field-for-field; the response shape is the source of truth — every
         panel JSX in ``docs/designer_dashboard/`` reads from this.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-08
Input: Pydantic models only.
Output: ``DashboardResponse`` and the nested models that compose it.

Keep names and types aligned with ``hifi-data.jsx``. Adding a new field is
fine; renaming or retyping breaks the JSX-side panel that reads it.
