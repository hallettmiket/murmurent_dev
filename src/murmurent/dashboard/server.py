"""
Purpose: FastAPI app for the hi-fi dashboard. Serves the data contract at
         ``GET /api/dashboard`` and the static React/JSX assets from
         ``docs/designer_dashboard/`` so the existing hi-fi HTML can be
         opened straight from the browser.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-08
Input: ``MURMURENT_USER`` environment variable (or ``?user=`` query param)
       to scope the snapshot to a member.
Output: JSON + static files. Served via uvicorn.

Run::

    murmurent dashboard --hifi          # defaults to localhost:8770
    murmurent dashboard --hifi --port 8888

Open `http://localhost:8770/` in a browser.

        Reads the actor from the handler's standard ``user`` query kwarg and
        wraps the call in ``use_lab_mgmt_root(resolve_viewer_lab_mgmt(actor))``.
        A no-op when the viewer isn't registry-claimed (single-lab install →
        override ``None`` → normal resolution, which the registry net already
        makes correct for the machine owner). Kept fully isolated: any
        resolution hiccup falls back to unscoped rather than 500-ing the route.

        The wrapper runs the handler in the SAME call (hence same thread), which
        is what makes the thread-local override reliable under FastAPI's sync
        threadpool. ``functools.wraps`` preserves the original signature so
        FastAPI's dependency introspection is unaffected.

            non-self bookings are only allowed for core leaders /
            registrars (e.g. leader fronts a slot for a member who
            can't reach the dashboard).
          - ``requester_lab``: lab slug for billing. Defaults to the
            calling lab (``lab.load_lab_config().lab``).
          - ``tier``: fee tier key. Defaults to the first tier on the
            service. Must be present in ``service.fee.tiers`` when
            the service prices anything.
          - ``modifiers``: list of modifier keys to multiply through.
          - ``notes``: free-text brief for the core staff.

        Gates: actor must be active; training prereq must pass (the
        same check the dashboard greys the Book button with); service
        must exist and be ``active``. Fee is snapshotted at booking
        time via :func:`services.quote_fee` so later catalog edits
